   - Performance visualization

### API Endpoints

```
GET  /retraining/status  - Get current retraining status
POST /retraining/start   - Start auto-retraining service
POST /retraining/stop    - Stop auto-retraining service
POST /retraining/force   - Force immediate retraining
```

## Configuration Options

### Retraining Triggers
- **min_new_samples**: Minimum new data points needed (default: 100)
- **retrain_interval_hours**: Hours between automatic checks (default: 24)
- **performance_threshold**: Minimum improvement required (default: 0.05)

### Model Management

- **rollback_capability**: Automatic revert on poor performance

## Usage Guide

### Starting the Retraining Service

```python
from ml_retraining import start_retraining_service

# Start the background service
retrainer = start_retraining_service()
```

### Manual Retraining

```python
from ml_retraining import get_retrainer

retrainer = get_retrainer()
success = retrainer.force_retrain()
```

### API Usage

```bash
# Check status
curl http://localhost:8000/retraining/status

# Start service
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/retraining/start

# Force retraining
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/retraining/force
```

## Dashboard Features

### Status Monitoring

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: Users browse, add to cart, purchase
2. **Data Collection**: User behaviors logged to database
3. **Monitoring**: Background service checks for new data
4. **Trigger Evaluation**: Assess if retraining conditions are met
5. **Model Training**: Train new models with latest data
6. **Validation**: Compare new model performance
7. **Deployment**: Deploy improved models or rollback
8. **Reporting**: Update performance history and dashboard

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics
- **Model Accuracy**: Classification performance for churn prediction
- **Mean Squared Error**: Regression performance for spending prediction
- **Training Frequency**: How often models are retrained
- **Data Quality**: Completeness and consistency of training data
