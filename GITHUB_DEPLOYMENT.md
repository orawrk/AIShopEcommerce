## Setting Up GitHub Repository

To create a shareable Git repository for your AI Shopping Platform, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**: Visit [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. **Create New Repository**: Click the "+" icon → "New repository"
3. **Repository Settings**:
   - Repository name: `ai-shopping-platform` (or your preferred name)
   - Description: `AI-Powered E-Commerce Platform with ML capabilities`
   - Set as **Public** (for sharing) or **Private** (for personal use)
   - **Do NOT** initialize with README (your project already has one)
   - **Do NOT** add .gitignore (your project already has one)

### Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the GitHub repository, you'll see setup instructions. Use these commands:

```bash
# Add GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# Push your existing code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Alternative - Replit GitHub Integration

**Option A: Use Replit's Built-in GitHub Integration**

1. In your Replit project, look for the **Git** or **Version Control** tab in the sidebar
2. Click **"Connect to GitHub"** or **"Push to GitHub"**
3. Authorize Replit to access your GitHub account
4. Choose to create a new repository or connect to existing one
5. Replit will automatically push your code

**Option B: Export via Replit Interface**

1. In Replit, go to your project settings
2. Look for **"Export to GitHub"** or **"Git Integration"** options
3. Follow the prompts to create and link a GitHub repository

### Step 4: Repository Structure

Your GitHub repository will contain:

```
ai-shopping-platform/
├── README.md                    # Main project documentation
├── RECENT_UPDATES.md           # Latest changes and improvements
├── replit.md                   # Project configuration and preferences
├── main_app.py                 # Streamlit frontend application
├── backend/                    # FastAPI backend with controllers
├── data/                       # Sample data and ML training files
├── models/                     # Trained ML models
├── docs/                       # Documentation and guides
└── .streamlit/                 # Streamlit configuration
```

### Step 5: Repository Features to Enable

After pushing to GitHub, consider enabling:

1. **GitHub Pages**: For hosting documentation
2. **Issues**: For bug tracking and feature requests  
3. **Actions**: For CI/CD automation
4. **Releases**: For version management
5. **Wiki**: For extended documentation

### Step 6: Sharing Your Repository

Once your repository is on GitHub, you can share it using:

- **Repository URL**: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME`
- **Clone URL**: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git`
- **Releases**: Create tagged releases for stable versions

### Step 7: Maintenance

To keep your GitHub repository updated:

```bash
# Add changes
git add .

# Commit changes with descriptive message
git commit -m "Enhanced user interface and database connectivity"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```
